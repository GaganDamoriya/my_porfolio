              As a Full Stack Developer, I thrive in the realm of web
              development, with a strong command of front-end technologies like
              React,Nodejs,React Redux,etc,.. My skills extend to the backend,
              where I'm always exploring and keep experimenting with new
              technology, APIs,dataBase etc . Committed to crafting seamless
              user experiences and writing clean, efficient code, I bridge the
              gap between design and functionality. My passion for innovation
              and problem-solving fuels my ambition to excel further in both
              frontend and backend development. With a dynamic skill set, I'm
              poised to create impactful digital solutions and contribute
              meaningfully to any project.
